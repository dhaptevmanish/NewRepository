This will come in handy when we have to use the same method again and again for different number of arguments

eg:

sum (x,y) {
}

sum (x,y){
}

here in order to execute sum method, when we need an new argument to be added we have to again and again call that method

if we use vararg method using ellipsis we need to call that method each and every time.
