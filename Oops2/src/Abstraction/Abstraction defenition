Abstraction--> Hiding the implementation part (hiding a method)

Abstract can be acheived in 2 ways --> Abstract and Interface.

Abstract class (mention abstract before classname to ensure thats a abstract class)
=======================================================================================
1) It contains both abstract and non abstract methods
2) we need to use abstract keyword to use abstract methods 
3) we need to use extends keyword to use abstract methods
4) we cannot create object for both abstract and interface.

Interface (interface is not class)
=======================================
1) It only contains abstract methods 
2) By default all are abstract here so we dont need to use keyword abstract 
3) To implement interface we need ti use implements keyword & we can achieve multiple inheritance here.
4) we need to use implements to connect 2 interfaces..
5) we can create objects for interfaces...
6) Multilevel inheritance can be achieved here using implements keyword.
